After a super fun start to the week, let's get a bit academic. On the fourth day of GCE 2023, our own professor, Dr Tripta Bhatia (DPS IISER-Mohali) is taking us on a ride to explore the fascinating world of biophysics and soft matter sciences. <!--more--> One of the most active and relevant field of research today, biophysics uses tools from soft condensed matter physics, mathematics and data science to try and understand the physical laws that govern enigmatic biological processes. Dr Bhatia will give us an overview of the field in general and walk us through the current and upcoming areas of research. Looking forward to a gripping lecture and your enthusiastic participation.
