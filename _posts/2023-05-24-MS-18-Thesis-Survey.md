# Astrophysics and Cosmology

## Cosmological Data Analysis
**Title**: Cosmological Data Fitting [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/PRJ502_Poster-AdityaPawanSaikri.pdf)  
**Name**: Aditya Pawan Saikia (MS18208)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Harvinder Kaur Jassal

**Brief explanation**:  
*We analyzed two supernova datasets: Pantheon, and Pantheon+SH0ES, and applied both chi$^2$ and Principal Component analyses to the standard Lambda CDM model of cosmology. We used PCA for reducing the number of parameters without reducing variability in chi$^2$ while chi$^2$ analysis was used in two optimization algorithms: hyperparametric grid search, and Nelder-Mead/Downhill simplex search.*
  
**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**   
*Astrophysics has been my field of choice, and I was motivated to choose something in Cosmology after the very difficult course in Relativistic Cosmology (PHY663). Dr. Jassal was willing to offer a thesis where my work would not be in the more difficult early universe portion, but more towards things like optimization of the parameters that describe how our universe evolved.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*Long searches on google scholar, google, and whenever I hit a roadblock in my code I always had StackExchange as a go-to.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**
*I am planning on doing some more work to see this through to its conclusion because Dr. Jassal is interested in a paper on this topic and I want to clean up any last mistakes in the code and disagreements in the theory.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*It depends on how much does one want to go deeper down the iceberg; one can start from the Friedmann equations itself in a book and derive the formulae I have in my poster, but if one wants to know how these came about they will need a good background in General Relativity. Two books (which are not related to my thesis) which I would recommend if you want to get into cosmology are J. B. Hartle's introduction to General Relativity if you want the mathematical background to GR, and Scott Dodelson's Modern Cosmology for those who want to delve into Relativistic Cosmology and are familiar with GR. Both build up very steadily in difficulty.*

## Dark Matter

**Title**: WIMP decay as possible WDM model [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Thesisposter2-AbineetParichha.pdf)  
**Name**: Abineet Parichha (MS18094)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Harvinder Kaur Jassal  
**External Guide**: Dr. Shiv K Sethi (RRI Bangalore)

**Brief explanation**:  
*Given the discrepancies between CDM N body simulations and observations and the lack of detection of WIMP (one of the strongest CDM particle candidate), we are motivated to consider the decay of WIMP into lighter warmer dark matter particles and radiation. We build the linear perturbation theory pertaining to this model and test its consequences on the structure formation in our universe using Planck 2018 CMB, BOSS (BAO) and SDSS (Lyman alpha) neutral hydrogen data sets. We compute constraints on properties of the dark matter particle like its mass and cross-section and discuss its implications on dark matter searches.*

## Exoplanets

**Title**: To mitigate the effect of moonlight contamination in spectroscopic searches for extrasolar planets [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/EPRV5-Poster-Komal(3)-KomalBali.pdf)  
**Name**: Komal Bali (MS18192)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla  
**External Guide**: Dr. Joe Philip Ninan  

**Brief explanation**:  
*Solar light contamination from lunar and atmospheric scattering of sunlight, results in systematic errors in stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements. It can significantly reduce the 10 cm/s sensitivity required to detect and characterize terrestrial exoplanets in or near habitable zones of Sun-like stars (Roy et al., 2020). NEID (NN-EXPLORE Exoplanet Investigations with Doppler Spectroscopy) is an optical EPRV Spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, USA. The NEID fiber head comprises sky fiber, science fiber, cal fiber, and coherent fiber bundles (CFBs).*
 *In this work, I present the effectiveness of using the simultaneous data from the sky fiber to correct for the solar light contamination in the science fiber spectra of the star. This correction technique is expected to reduce this source of sky contamination error to below the photon-noise limit of typical stellar observations.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*My previous experiences in the field of exoplanets.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*Mostly a combination of astronomical science and data analysis on the spectrograph's data and some computational aspects.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**  
*I will be working in exoplanetary sciences, but I am not yet sure of the exactly narrowed down topic. I love both the atmospheric work as well as the detection techniques.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
One can refer to the following papers:
- Roy et al., 2020
- Wright, J. T. (2017)

## Galactic Dynamics

**Title**: Simulation studies of Black Holes (BH) originating in Globular clusters [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/PRJ50X_Thesis_Poster_A1__Portrait__MS18006(1)-ShivShankarSingh.pdf)  
**Name**: Shiv Shankar Singh (MS18006)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla  


**Brief explanation**:  
*Black holes (BHs) are celestial objects characterized by their extraordinary gravitational forces, which are so powerful that they prevent even light from escaping. Within globular clusters, densely packed groups of stars held together by gravity, the presence and evolution of BHs significantly influence the dynamical processes unfolding in these systems.*
*This study aims to examine the behavior of BHs originating in globular clusters, with a particular focus on understanding their dynamics as they move rapidly through the cluster. By creating a realization of a Plummer sphere, we analyze the equilibrium state of the system and introduce a massive particle to represent a BH.*
*Our investigation delves into the dynamics of this massive particle as it traverses the Plummer sphere, taking into account the effects of dynamical friction. The findings from our simulations offer valuable insights into the dynamics of BHs in globular clusters, enhancing our understanding of their behavior within these dense stellar environments.*


**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*A brief motivation:*

*Globular clusters, dense spherical assemblies of stars orbiting the outskirts of galaxies, provide invaluable insights into galaxy formation, evolution, and the nature of dark matter. With high-density cores, these clusters are thought to harbor a significant number of black holes (BHs). However, the dynamics and time evolution of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a simple model to investigate the dynamics of massive objects, such as BHs, moving through a globular cluster, employing both N-body simulations and analytical methods.*
*Previous studies have suggested that globular clusters may eject some of their BHs through various encounter mechanisms. However, there has been no evidence to support this idea. We explore how the dynamics of massive compact objects (BH) would evolve if the BHs had significant kick velocities* ($v > v_{escape}$) *upon formation.*
*Using the Plummer sphere model and the Barnes-Hut algorithm, we conducted N-body simulations for an initial population of* $1 \times 10^5$ *stars and massive compact objects (BHs) with masses ranging from* $10^2$ *to* $10^3$ *solar masses. Our results provide insights into the implications of introducing BHs with significant kick velocities and how this affects their dynamics within the globular cluster.*


**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*We simulated the Plummer sphere using the Barnes-Hut algorithm to establish the time-stationary nature of the Plummer sphere.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**  
*I wish to work on more simulations and understand the dynamics from a numerical point of view. Additionally, I plan to work on observational data and compare it with my simulation data to assess our understanding of the laws of physics.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*After the thesis submission is complete, I will upload all the relevant materials and code on my GitHub page. You are welcome to explore everything there. While the research problem which I was trying to address is not taken up by many researchers, you can still refer to the references mentioned in the poster for further information.*

## Bioinformatics

**Title**: Protein Residue Contact Network Analysis to understand function of Single Residue Mutations [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/final_print_poster_ms180067-DhanasekharVk.pdf)  
**Name**: Dhanasekhar V.K (MS18067)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Sashi Bhushan Pandit  
**External Guide**: Prof. Somadatta Sinha  



**Brief explanation**:  
*Protein is very essential for biological function and maintaining homeostasis in our body. A small alteration of protein structure can be responsible for the change in function from small to complete loss of function. To understand the structure change and functional correlation associated with single residue mutation(in this work) we used the graph theory approach. And to quantify the characteristic change we came up with a scoring matrix that can correlate the amino acid property with the phenotypic function of the mutated protein.*  

  
**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**    
*I will explain it with a representative example of Sickle cell anemia in which a change in one amino acid glutamic acid changes to valine in the beta subunit of hemoglobin. The result from the human genome project shows that the human genome is varied in the presence of single nucleotide variation(single nucleotide polymorphism) and a lot of diseases are associated with single residue variation. So if we know the behavior of the changes that are caused by small variations we can predict the structure-function correlation associated with this mutation.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*Learned a basic understanding of the tools and methods that are used in this work, and followed current research articles that they are working with single residue mutation. I discussed with the local supervisor and lab member for guidance and mentorship.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*You can read research articles that are related to network science and protein science.*

## Non-Linear Dynamics and Theoretical ecology

**Title**: Threshold-Activated Predator Dispersal in Spatially Extended Ecological Systems [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/PRJ502_Poster-MS18157-Final(1)-ShreyasRavindraGadge.pdf)  
**Name**: Shreyas Gadge (MS18157)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Sudeshna Sinha  

**Brief explanation**:
*We look at a density-dependent dispersal rule - threshold-activated dispersal for predators in a tritrophic (vegetation-prey-predator) food web model, extended spatially.*
*The original model by Blasius et. al. (without dispersal) suggests a uniform phase oscillation with chaotic amplitude (UPCA) dynamics for predators in the vertical three-species food-chain strikingly similar to the natural Canadian Lynx population cycle across years. We look at dispersal of predators from a single ecological patch undergoing local food web dynamics into the external world and observe the stabilisation of the original chaotic dynamics for low threshold values*
*We also observe a stabilisation of predators to period-2 cycle but saturation with high oscillation amplitude for dispersal at low threshold in a closed-ring of ecological patches (ring size (N) =3).*
*Synchronisation in predator population across patches is also observed for low threshold values. Stability analysis suggests an unstable  2D vegetation-prey system with evidence of extreme events when the predator is fixed at the critical threshold. Our study explores a novel dispersal rule dependent on the local patch dynamics and the results have the potential to understand the stability of real-world ecological systems. In addition, we find that threshold-activated dispersal is a probable factor to induce extreme events or extinction across species in the tritrophic model, and hence, has an application in conservation studies.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*I was always interested in complex systems with a curiosity to study emergent properties across biological scales (neuronal to individual to populations). Having worked on computational models in neuroscience, I wanted to probe questions at a larger scale like stability of ecological populations connected in space. Stability is influenced by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and this particular question was interesting to me as it allowed me to uncover the complexity of systems with an interplay between intrinsic food web dynamics and extrinsic dispersal dynamics as factors affecting the emergent property of stability and persistence.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*Having a quantitative background in modeling complex systems gave a headstart to understand the mathematical encoding of ecological systems. However, since I was new to ecological systems, intensive literature reviews suggested by my guide and also explored by myself helped in getting familiar with concepts of ecological dynamics and their theoretical understanding. Interdisciplinary studies bring several challenges as it has to be probed with multiple viewpoints, and spending considerable time on the basic model and the groundwork before extending the complexity contributed to establishing a comfort level with the system. Discussing the ideas (even the most stupid ones) regularly with my guide and peers also contributed to the learning. There is a certain advantage with theoretical modeling, the quick feedback which forms a great check and balance way of working.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*I plan to work in the same broad field of nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. However, I would be shifting to a different set of systems to uncover the similar questions on stability and spatiotemporal dynamics across social and urban ecosystems perturbed by factors like climate change.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**
*For non-linear dynamics, Steven Strogatz's book is a great place to start (you need to have done courses in classical mechanics for this).* 
*Several courses are regularly offered at IISER where you can learn more about complex systems - Non-linear dynamics, Theoretical Biology, Network Science, Theory of Computation, etc. You can also go to the Moodle archive (2020-21 even sem) and find lectures on modeling complex systems (IDC621) by Prof Sudeshna Sinha.*
*For this field, once you are familiar with the concept of differential equations or functional maps and basic coding, you can build up your knowledge using basic papers such as* [*Nature article*](https://www.nature.com/articles/20676) *and* [*Physical Review Letters article*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.4083) *and try to reproduce some basic results.*

**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Manjari Jain  
**External Guide**: Dr. Jonathan Henshaw  


**Brief explanation**:  
*In some animals like the long-tailed dancefly, males bring nutritious substances to females before mating (called a nuptial gift). A curious role-reversal then takes place in some species where the females evolve special ornaments to attract males (instead of the usual males attracting females!). My project investigates different ecological conditions via a simulation to figure out exactly what causes the evolution of female ornaments in species with nuptial gifts so ecologists can predict this trait's evolution in other species.*

**Name**: Shweta Saini (MS18143)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Jogender Singh  
**External Guide**: Prof. Ibrahim Tarik Ozbolat  

**Brief explanation**:  
*It is an interdisciplinary project that includes engineering and biology.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*I was always interested in medicine. Initially my interests were in Solid Organ Transplantation but problems like Immune Suppression and Graft Rejection is making the success rate very low. To tackle this problem elaborate research is being done in the field of Stem cells and Tissue Engineering that can use patient specific cells and a cadaver for developing artificial organ. Recently, 3D printing has become very popular, using the same principal, in place of the ink, if a bioink is used, it is called 3D Bioprinting. A hydrogel having cells can be used as a bioink to develop a structure of choice. I feel that this field has the potential to solve the problems faced during solid organ transplantation and I hope there will be a day when no one will die while being on a waiting list for an organ. My thesis mostly focussed on Microfluidics that can be used for a better in vitro drug testing platform.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**  
*Yes, I will be going to the same university, Penn State University and planning to join a lab that is working in the same field of Stem cells and Tissue Engineering.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*People who are interested to learn more about this field can visit the lab web page of [Ozbolat Lab](https://www.personal.psu.edu/ito1/index.html). Additionally, you can refer to the following publications related to my thesis work:*

**Brief explanation**:  
*Today, much effort is being put into tracking the changes in Technology and Science. This is because the results produced are not only informative but also useful, as is in the case with figuring out "Emerging Technologies". In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of Graph Theory or Network Science. We design a way to construct keyword networks and identifying groups of communities within them using the techniques of Graph Convolutional Neural Network and Random Walks. Each major community identified represents a hot topic of research in the year of a field for which data has been taken.*

## Models in Knowledge Production
**Title**: Models in Knowledge Production [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Mayukh_Thesis_Poster-MayukhChakrabarty.pdf)  
**Name**: Mayukh Chakrabarty (MS18046)  
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Neeraja Sahasrabudhe  
**External Guide**: Dr. Tathagata Sengupta


**Brief explanation**:  
*The thesis attempts to analyze models as a particular class of representation in natural and social sciences. Their uniqueness arises from a structural correspondence between the model and its target, defined in particular contexts. We attempt to (i) sketch a history of models in knowledge production and (ii) understand how they function. Models are employed to perform descriptive and prescriptive roles; we explore the extremes where description and prescription overwhelm one another, respectively. We move into insurance modeling as a central example in the thesis. We focus only on the aspect of risk transfer marked by contractual obligations. In the four-hundred year of its history, we see it evolve from striking a bargain to a mathematically robust enterprise. The evolution happens in conversations between disciplines such as mathematics, astronomy, economics, and sociology under the larger context of statecraft and population management*

  
**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*Models are so ubiquitous in disciplines that we do not look back and think about how they came to be. I have not seen anything like models, so speculative and yet so authoritative. However, it seems like their development has somehow managed to escape historical scrutiny, making them appear timeless. Hence, the thesis.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*Initially, we planned to examine the philosophy and ethicality of models. However, a good amount of work was already done on it. The historical part, on the other hand remain underexplored, and still needs to be excavated from other scientific works.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**  
*I definitely plan to work on it, but probably not as a PhD dissertation.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*For the philosophical part, look at the list of references in the SEP articles of models in science and scientific representation. If someone can find a good secondary literature of the historical part, please drop me an email at mayukh.math@gmail.com.*

**Title**: A Combinatorial approach to Knot theory and its applications [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Poster_Presentation_MS_thesis_IISER-BhavneetSinghSaini.pdf)
**Name**: Bhavneet Singh Saini (MS18069)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Shane D'Mello

**Brief explanation**: 
Mathematical Knots in 3-dimensional space can be imagined as closed loops with their over and under-crossings. The primary problem of knot theory is that of classification. For that purpose, we look at various invariants of knots which, as the name suggests, stay unchanged when we look at a different diagram of the same knot. These invariants were originally formulated using complex machinery. In this thesis, we looked at various combinatorial structures that bring out these invariants. The goal is to extract information other than the invariant from these combinatorial structures which includes some applications in biology.

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*I wanted to explore topology and its applications in other fields, specifically Knot theory.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*I'll continue in this field, exploring more deeply the applications of Knot theory in studying Protein structures and folding.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**
*To begin with one can look at Knot Knotes by Justin Roberts. To look more into the combinatorial side and its applications, one can look at this book Knot theory and its applications by Kunio Murasugi.*

## Modular Forms, Number Theory

**Title**: Modular Forms and its Applications [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Modular_Forms_and_its_Applications__Poster-2-JishnuKundu.pdf)
**Name**: Jishnu Kundu (MS18064)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Vaibhav Vaish

**Brief explanation**:
*A modular form is a function on upper half-plane following certain holomorphy and transformation condition.First, we introduce the concepts of modular forms and show how it is connected to the concepts of complex elliptic curves. Modular curves have been introduced as a more natural domain of modular forms than the upper half-plane. Modular curves have been studied as compact Riemann surfaces along with deciphering various of its properties like - the genus, number of cusps, and number of elliptic points of various orders, etc. Later on we focus on the space of modular forms and its sub-spaces, followed by the computation of dimensions and basis for the spaces using different machineries like the modified Eisenstein series and Hecke theory. Finally, we discuss some applications of modular forms in proving Number theoretic problems using these theories.*

  
**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*I took interest in the algebraic side of Number theory, especially the famous - Fermat's Last Theorem. In order to study the proof deeply, I wanted to understand the Modularity theorem for elliptic curves and that's the primary reason for diving into this research area.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*Researching on the thesis initially was following a certain reference into account and moving forward by bridging those gap kept as an exercise for the readers. Solving problems followed by biweekly presentation in front of seniors as well as my guide helped in increasing my clarity for the subject. In the process of learning I had to revisit several previous topics as well as new ones that were never taught in course through online lectures or various other books, articles, research papers etc.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**
*I would prefer to continue on my thesis, but I can accept slight divergences from the main topic as I have interests in Analytic Number theory too mainly in the studies of L-functions towards the problems of the Riemann Hypothesis or the Sub-convexity Bound problem of L-functions.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*An introductory text for this topic would be "A First Course in Modular Forms"- by Diamond & Shurman and to study applications one can check the book " The 1-2-3" of Modular Forms by Don Zagier. In order to understand the texts thoroughly one must have some understanding of the topics of Manifolds, Fourier Analysis, a bit of basic Analytic Number Theory, Representation Theory, Fuschian Groups, Elliptic Curves, etc.*

## Probability (Polya urns and Preferential attachment)

**Title**: Properties of Preferential Attachment Trees with constant fitness [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Posterms-RimjhimGoel.pdf)
**Name**: Rimjhim Goel (MS18133)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Neeraja Sahasrabudhe

**Brief explanation**:
*We basically look at the phenomena of preferential attachment in random graphs that helps to generate networks/graphs that are close to real-life networks. For example, consider the citation network, the social networks, world wide web, telephone networks etc. These networks are huge, still growing and have a high likelihood of hubs formation.*
*Preferential attachment models are dynamic and can be mimic the growth of such networks. Intiutively, preferential attachment means the more connected vertex in a graph is more attractive for a newcomer attaching to the graph at a later stage. It is a manifestation of rich grows richer, success breeds success or the first mover advantage principles.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*I found this very interesting as well as approachable. Also, it is currently very popular among researchers, not just probabilists but also for network specialists and physicists. Literature was available (many recent papers too). Did not have much background in probability and learnt a lot in my exploration of this topic.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*Started with a paper that I found readable (sent by my thesis guide). Once I got comfortable, tried exploring more along similar lines.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**
*This is a nice thing to look at and has a lot of 'scope' as well. But I am not sure yet.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**
*Start with any standard random graph theory book and get familiar with the techniques used. I had Hofstad. You will find Albert Barabasi model there. Or search random recursive trees on a plane. Wikipeadia also has some nice articles. Try to look at applications. You will find many in molecular biology and also in phylogenetic trees related papers. Janson, Zhang and Mahmoud are some authors you might want to look at.*

# Physics

## Belle II Data Analysis via CNN

**Title**: Recovery of merged $π^0$ from the ECL detector of the Belle II experiment [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/MS18102_Poster-NaveenKumarBaghel.pdf)
**Name**: Naveen Kumar Baghel (MS18102)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Vishal Bhardwaj

**Brief explanation**: 
*This study aims to utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to retrieve merged $π^0$mesons lost in the Belle II experiment, where they appear as individual photons. The issuearises when dealing with high momentum $π^0$ mesons, i.e., beyond 2 GeV in the Belle IIexperiment, as the shower produced by both the $π^0$ meson and gamma appear indistinguishable at the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECL detector). Currently, reconstruction software is utilized to match photon pairs created by the $π^0$ → γγ decay; however, the efficiency of this process can be affected by the γ produced by the rest of the events (ROEs), which mimic the signal. One of the most challenging tasks in particle 
physics research is accurately identifying and reconstructing subatomic particles. By the nature of the problem and its importance, accurate reconstruction of $π^0$ mesons is crucial for identifying various B/D meson decays.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*I chose this topic because I wanted to work at the intersection of machine learning and particle physics.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*I explored the resources and materials available in the BELLE II community to learn and conduct research for my thesis.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*Yes, I plan to continue working on my thesis topic in the future.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**
*Interested individuals can refer to my thesis, which contains relevant information including basics, codes, and more.*

**Title**: Magneto-transport in the presence of spin orbit coupling [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Poster_presentation-1-Sourabh.pdf)
**Name**: Sourabh (MS18037)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Sanjeev Kumar

**Brief explanation**:
*Spin orbit coupling is the interaction between an electron's momentum and its spin. The objective of the work is to investigate the conductivity of various lattice structures under the influence of a spin orbit coupling and an external magnetic field, and to determine if any theoretical and computational insights can be made, as well as to see is there any similarity between some experimentally observed results*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*I was interested in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*I started by reading literature referred by my guide, including research papers and parts of  relevant books. Once I had a rough idea of what needed to be done, I began working on my thesis with guidance from Dr. Sanjeev. I also utilized internet resources throughout the research process. Of course the internet was always there.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*Once I feel that I have exhausted the possibilities in this specific topic, I plan to switch to a different area within condensed matter physics.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**
*One can refer to my thesis once it is printed and submitted.*

## Condensed Matter Physics

**Title**: Interacting bosons on an optical lattice [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/MS18117_PRJ502_First_Draft-AkshayShankar.pdf)

**Name**: Akshay Shankar (MS18117)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Sanjeev Kumar
**External Guide**: Prof. Dr. Tilman Pfau

**Brief explanation**:
*Consider the following setup; a bunch of particles are cooled down to extremely low temperatures and loaded onto a lattice made using lasers. Such an optical lattice is highly tunable (lattice spacing, depth, etc), lending itself to convenient experimental exploration for a large range of parameters.*
*In this project, we explore the various quantum phases of matter that can be achieved in this system by introducing different types of interactions between the bosonic particles. In doing so, we further progress the quest to construct 'quantum simulators' that can be used to study other condensed matter systems that are harder to access experimentally.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**

*My third year summer project began as an attempt to explore high performance computing (HPC), with little regard to the physics involved. I ended up in a lab working on quantum fluids using HPC and naturally got interested in the field as well. Of particular interest to me was the peculiar 'supersolid' phase that was exhibited in a system of dipolar BECs. However, the project came to an end before I got to explore this properly, so I figured I'd continue this line of study for my thesis.*
*It might be worth noting that I just followed a weak thread of interests blindly and it seems to have worked out so far. It is ridiculous to expect yourself to have figured out your research interests entirely by the fourth year. Sometimes you just go with the flow and correct your course over time.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**

*With pain. My thesis required me to have a basic knowledge of AMO (atomic, molecular, and optical physics) and CMT (Condensed matter theory). The first course is taken at IISER and I had the ill luck to have it taught badly. The second was not offered for us till that point. I did begin working on my project in the summer, so I had the time to go through bits and pieces of books to piece together a working knowledge. Its not pretty and I still have gaping holes in my understanding, but as I see it, this is how research goes :)*
*Regarding the project specific details; it involves poring through numerous old papers, getting stuck in a never ending rabbit-hole of references and having to stack-trace your way back to what you were confused about to begin with. Its a lot of trial and error, a lot of tangents, and a lot of fun. Sometimes, if you review the literature thoroughly enough, you will start piecing together the formulation and evolution of certain topics in the field as the years went by. I thought it was quite interesting to see the rather non-linear and convoluted progression of science.*
*A word of advise is to learn how to 'read' papers by skimming their abstracts, etc, instead of blindly diving into all the content to begin with.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**

*Yes! Not the "exact" same thing, but a fairly related topic. In my thesis I intended to aid the development of quantum simulators, however, my work itself was entirely based on studying the physics of a particular hamiltonian. While it was useful to paving the way to quantum simulation, I found myself more interested in utilizing the end result to 'simulate' other systems! And that is what I hope to be working on in the future. Of course, I am sticking to my basic workflow though, which is to develop numerical software aided by collaboration with experimental efforts.*
*On that note, it is perfectly normal to end up realizing that your thesis topic was NOT your cup of tea at all. Its really a hit or miss, because what we found interesting at a surface level is by no means an indicator of our interest in the gory details of the field. It does get considerably harder to keep yourself motivated to continue when you are confused about what to pursue, but if you made it this far, I'm sure you'll get there!*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**

*Drop me a DM :) Discord: FlynnXD#2733 Otherwise, googling any of the fancy-schmancy words you see above will lead you down a fun rabbithole. Look out specifically for Master's and PhD thesis written by others. If you're courageous enough to look into papers, keep it restricted to reviews on the topic.*

## Monte Carlo of Quantum phase transitions

**Title**: Monte Carlo studies of quantum phase transitions [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/Kunal_MS18148_Poster-KunalVerma.png)
**Name**: Kunal Verma (MS18148)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Prof. Sanjeev Kumar
**External Guide**: Prof. Vijay B. Shenoy

**Brief explanation**:
*In this work, we study the quantum critical behavior of two different lattice models - Z2 lattice gauge theory and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, numerically, using Monte Carlo methods.*
*Z2 lattice gauge theory is the discrete cousin of electrodynamics, with the gauge group replaced from R to Z2. The model exhibits certain interesting phases, in particular, topological phases when studied in the topology of a torus. However, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom make it difficult to directly study such systems numerically. Therefore, we perform a dual transformation and map the gauge theory to a Transverse Field Ising model (a quantum Ising model) with the periodic boundary condition mapping to the so-called "singlet" constraint. We then employ the methodology of Path Integral Monte Carlo to map the 1d quantum system to a (1+1)d classical system which can be studied using the standard Metropolis algorithm.* 
*For the quantum J1-J2 model, we propose that the system can be understood as quantum fluctuations on top of a classical model. The methodology proposes that the J1-J2 model can be broken down as a J1-J2 Ising model with quantum fluctuations. The quantum fluctuations are encoded as a semi-classical dimer with the energy and magnetization of a two-site quantum dimer (thermal singlet and triplet states). The semi-classical Monte Carlo algorithm with spin flips and dimer annihilation/creation steps emulates a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation with lesser computational resources and results in accurately predicting the different phases of matter - the paramagnet, the Neel AFM state, the collinear AFM state and the spin liquid (quantum paramagnet) state.* 
*The Monte Carlo methods are good estimators of expectation values of relevant operators in the system and these averages can be used in estimating the critical exponents of the quantum phase transition using finite-size scaling analysis.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*The ideal intersection of theoretical physics and computational physics with applications in real-world systems.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*Primarily through lecture notes on Monte Carlo methods.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*I plan to continue working in the direction of quantum many-body physics and quantum information.*

## Neutrino Oscillations
**Title**: Alternative Methods to distinguish Matter Effects from CP Violation in Neutrino Oscillation experiments [(Poster)](https://github.com/PhiclubIISERM/phiclubiiserm.github.io/blob/master/external%20content/Posters/PRJ502_Poster_Pokhee-PokheeSaharia.pdf)
**Name**: Pokhee Saharia (MS18190)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Satyajit Jena
**External Guide**: Prof. Federico Sanchez

**Brief explanation**:
*Neutrinos are elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics, which come in three flavors (types) postulated by the model. They exhibit the phenomenon of changing flavors as they propagate through space - called neutrino oscillations. This particular phenomenon is the only aspect of physics beyond the Standard Model that is directly accessible experimentally, hence a very flourishing field in particle physics today.*
 *CP Violation is a fundamental asymmetry in physics - basically tells us how differently do particles and their antiparticles behave. Extended specifically to the case of neutrinos, CP violation in neutrino oscillations is the study of how differently do neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate from each other. A non-zero measured observable of this quantity could lead to answers about the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; i.e, since the Big Bang created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, how did this balance get thrown off in the history of the universe and leave us with a world made primarily of matter. Or, to put it more dramatically, how did we come to exist?*
 *Experimentally, the measurement of this asymmetry poses a problem, because (anti)neutrino beams in oscillation experiments are made to propagate through matter. Now, matter is fundamentally CP asymmetric, i.e, it affects neutrinos and antineutrinos differently. This leads to the generation of a matter-induce 'fake' component of CP violation in neutrino oscillations that reflects in measurements, preventing the observation of a genuine CP violation. My thesis focused on studying these matter effects and methods of separating them from genuine CP violation in the neutrino oscillation experiment T2K in Japan.*

  
**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**  
*I personally didn't pick this specific topic, because when I had joined the project I didn't have much idea about niche research on neutrinos, all my knowledge was from pop science. It was more of a progressive interest developed in the field while working on my thesis.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**  
*I had an extremely supportive supervisor and research group at the University of Geneva. Since the entire group worked on the same experiment, I was never short of help at any point during the process. Most of my learning and researching process involved heavy discussions with people, and reading technical notes and former PhD theses of the experiment about the schematics and detector setups. I did not follow a set method or any particular textbook.*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else?**
*Yes, I plan to continue working on this topic for my PhD as well.*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis?**  
*My preferred method of learning about any niche topic has always been to go on INSPIRE-HEP (an open source repository of high energy physics literature) and look for former PhD theses related to the topic. I've always found reading these way more helpful than any textbook or publication.*

**Name**: Suroj Dey (MS18221)
**Local Thesis Guide**: Dr. Kinjalk Lochan
**External Guide**: Prof. Shankaranarayanan

**Brief explanation**: 
*This work studies the entanglement generation between two quantum systems by interactions locally mediated by a third physical system.*

**Why did you decide to choose this topic/problem for your thesis?**
*Chosen by my supervisor; I found the problem interesting, so decided to stick to it.*

**How did you go about learning and researching for your thesis?**
*I was given a particular problem and we decided upon a model to work with, I then learned the relevant topics/tools/methods as I went along working with my model and trying to solve specific problems. Literature survey, relevant books and talking to people in related field were important sources for my learning and researching. As for researching, it mostly involved trying, failing, looking at the literature/books for possible clues, talking to other people in related fields (sometimes it can be more helpful than talking to your supervisor), trying different approaches (for example, doing numerical analysis, if analytical progress is difficult for the moment, reading tools and methods used in different but related works - sometimes tools developed for one problem can also be modified to be used in another, which was the case for my work).*

**Do you plan to continue working on your thesis topic in the future, or changing to something else? (Elaborate if necessary)**
*Changing to something else, this work was not about exploring a topic but rather mainly focused towards answering some particular questions, although there is scope for future study, I prefer to explore other research problems in the future..*

**How can one learn more about work related to your thesis? (Add specifics if possible)**
*References in the poster can be a good start. One can then explore the literature surrounding the two references cited, specifically the "Bose-Marletto-Vedral" experimental proposal and relevant literature associated with it.*
